        <p>QUEENS — Dancers hit the stage for the Queensboro Dance Festival last September, with over two dozen companies from all corners of Queens. But advocates say bringing together dancers in the biggest borough hasn't been so easy.</p>

        <p>“Queens is the biggest borough. It's the most diverse borough," said Karesia Batan, founder of the Queensboro Dance Festival, a summer tour of performances and classes based in Queens.

          <p>"There must be stuff happening here that, but why don't we know about it?” </p>

        <p>Advocates named inaccessible transportation, premium-priced rehearsal space, and disproportionate borough funding as reasons that Queens have been left on the arts hub outskirts.</p>

        <p>For dancers in Queens, the odds can feel especially stacked against them.</p>
